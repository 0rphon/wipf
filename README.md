A Zipf's law analyzation tool for Wikipedia pages\
Zipf's law, or the Zipfian distribution, is an empirical law that states that the amount of times a word is used in a document is directly proportional to its rank among how often other words were used. Meaning the second most common word in a book is used 1/2 as much as the most common word, the third most common 1/3rd as much, the 4th 1/th as much, and so on. Based on this, we can theoretically predict how often each word is used by comparing the most common word to the Zipfian distribution.\
